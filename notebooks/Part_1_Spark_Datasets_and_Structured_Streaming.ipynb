      "\n",
      "1. Transparently processes data on multiple nodes in the cloud while giving the programmer an API that's little more complex than Scala's `Seq` API.\n",
      "1. Resiliently handles failures by restarting processess.\n",
      "1. Spills data to disk as necessary but prefers to intelligently cache in ram for faster processing.\n",
      "1. Java, Scala, Python, R, and SQL APIs (although we will primarily be using the Scala one).\n",
